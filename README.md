# Age and gender classification using CNN

This is the implementation of [Age and Gender Classification by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner](https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/cnn_agegender/CVPR2015_CNN_AgeGenderEstimation.pdf) using PyTorch as the deep learning framework and Google Colab as the training ground. The network proposed in the paper has five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers, and is simple enough to understand and get familiar with PyTorch and Colab. Try it!
